# DraggableStage

The `DraggableStage` component wraps a `Stage`, allowing its viewport to be panned around and zoomed.

When a Konva node is marked as `draggable` within a `DraggableStage`, the `useDraggable` hook should be used so that the node 
stays in place when the mouse is dragged on the node, but is meant for a viewport pan (i.e. holding shift or using the
middle mouse button.)
